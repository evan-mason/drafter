# drafter
Angular C# MVC NBA Drafting application built for the boys.

version 0.6.2
Player picker basic is complete.

Methodology
I believe in the best possible configuration. When the website has made a change, it will use websockets to send the type of change made, player picked up etc. Then the appropiate components will be re-mounted. 

I think I will probe to check for changes every 5 seconds as this is the easiest way to implement it for now. a 5 second refresh is fine for me at this point.

Design

screens USER
-- F/A player (with sorting) #Phase 1 complete
-- Other Teams
-- Your Team
-- Watch list #Phase 2 -- Watch list v2 adding notes and where what pick you think they should go (will highligh if still available).
-- Timer/Draft State
-- Depth Charts #Phase 3 / 4
-- Projected stats using ESPN projections with our scoring system, last years stats also. Phase 2
-- Next best pick, and next best at position. 
-- fuck you button (if a player was picked that you wanted) Phase 2
-- review pick thats been 1/5 stars Phase 2
-- picks timeline
-- add the message service that appears when you select a row here (row selection > events) https://primeng.org/table#selection-events

screens PRESENTER Phase 3
-- Last pick video // not handled in carousel https://videogular.github.io/ngx-videogular/docs/ this will be a hidden full screen absolute position object. unhides on pick. hides and pauses after certain amount of minutes.
   we need to download the videos locally fml i wanna die, the server will serve them using the wwwroot.
-- Last pick stats
-- other random stats and current teams. 10 second cycle.
-- Next team picking
-- F/A playerlist
-- picks timeline
-- Timer/Draft State
-- End of draft summaries with videos
-- play sound on pick. draft sound. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44883501/play-sound-in-angular-4
-- Summaries include best team, worst pick, best shooters, tallest team, etc etc. Phase 4

PRESENTER IDEA ARCHETECTURE
-- It will be based on a carosel structure, hopefully css can control the animation to switch from slides to fades if need be. -- sorted
-- not sure about the video yet. But hopefully I can rip youtube videos locally. -- this can be an that triggers if pick was < 5 seconds ago. If window is open. play video?
-- we need to hide the values of the picked player if we want it to be a surprise, maybe a 30 second window before a new pick is revealed? depending on a setting.
   meaning we need to create a setting for the draft for this.

screen admin page
-- Settings
-- Start stop timer
-- Upload new players CSV -- THIS WORKS ALREADY, BUT CAN RE-SEED IF I WANT
-- Add and remove players based on master list ## THIS CAN BE DONE VIA DB IF NEEDED
-- Export Final Draft Phase 2

EXTRA FEATURES TO CONSIDER
-- compare players. use a checkbox and it will create a popup that will put all the players together (2 probably) then have red/green text.
-- Addition of rotowire news. see http://nbasense.com/nba-api/StatsProd/StatsCms/Rotowire/RotowirePlayer#request-example player ids are same as here https://www.nba.com/players


Improvements to make
- extract methods from API's to own apis and create services to handle object creation/manipulation. Controllers are doing too much. Phase 4
- Make everything async!!! Very important for these api calls. Remove wait synchronous calls that I had to add. Phase 4
- drafted players should be it's own table, so if we need to remove and reorder players. We can loop through the picked players from pick time and re assign using loop index. 
- change login url and controller routes # Phase 4
- have more than one draft Phase 5 if ever
- have more than one team per user 5 if ever
- remove admin team and user as it's a stupid implementation for it to make the seeder work Phase 4
- pull everything out into services where possible. Rather computing within repositories Phase 4/5
- Dashboard picks API has a very fat unneccessary response
- Pull out mat card when it was implemented in dashboard picks commit 6/7/2023
- Fix API slowness. No idea what's happening here atm.
- Handle draftplayerdashboard exception when drafting a player that's not avaliable.
- draftPlayer picking player does not reset time when done locally.
- Fix timer when it goes into negative
